# Generic Prompt Enhancement Strategy for Constraint Recognition

## Core Problem
LLMs often fail to recognize and prioritize critical constraints embedded in contextual information, treating all information with equal weight rather than identifying non-negotiable requirements.

## Research-Based Solution: Hierarchical Constraint Extraction Framework

### Key Principles from Research
1. **Explicit Instruction Hierarchy** improves compliance by ~41%
2. **Information Salience** - Beginning and end of prompts receive highest attention
3. **Structured Extraction** - Forcing explicit identification improves recognition
4. **Role-Based Framing** - Domain expertise framing enhances appropriate prioritization

=================================================================
CRITICAL ANALYSIS & CONSTRAINT EXTRACTION
=================================================================

Before creating any plan, you must complete this systematic analysis:

STEP 1: CONSTRAINT IDENTIFICATION
Read all provided analyses below and identify:
a) Non-negotiable requirements (safety, medical, physiological)
b) Strong recommendations (performance, optimization)
c) Flexible suggestions (preferences, options)

List your findings:
NON-NEGOTIABLE:
- ________________________________
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

STRONG RECOMMENDATIONS:
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

FLEXIBLE SUGGESTIONS:
- ________________________________
- ________________________________

=================================================================
DECISION HIERARCHY FRAMEWORK
=================================================================

When creating your plan, apply this strict hierarchy:

LEVEL 1 - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS (Cannot be overridden)
• Any safety-related constraints
• Physiological limitations or requirements
• Medical or health directives
• Explicitly stated minimums or maximums

LEVEL 2 - STRATEGIC PRIORITIES (Honor unless conflicting with Level 1)
• Competition or goal alignment
• Long-term development objectives
• Performance optimization targets

LEVEL 3 - TACTICAL PREFERENCES (Adjust as needed)
• Training variety and enjoyment
• Schedule convenience
• Equipment or venue preferences

=================================================================
PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY FRAMEWORK
=================================================================

You are operating as a professional coach with expertise in:
- Exercise physiology and adaptation
- Injury prevention and athlete safety
- Performance optimization
- Long-term athletic development

Your professional standards require:
1. Identifying and respecting all physiological constraints
2. Prioritizing athlete wellbeing over short-term gains
3. Making evidence-based decisions from the provided analyses
4. Documenting your reasoning for accountability

=================================================================
CONTEXTUAL ANALYSES FOR REVIEW
=================================================================

Carefully review each analysis section below. Pay special attention to:
- Temporal requirements (timing, duration, sequences)
- Intensity limitations or recommendations
- Volume constraints or targets
- Specific activity restrictions or requirements

### Metrics Analysis:
```markdown
{metrics_analysis}
```

### Activity Analysis:
```markdown
{activity_analysis}
```

### Physiology Analysis:
```markdown
{physiology_analysis}
```

=================================================================
CONSTRAINT INTEGRATION CHECKLIST
=================================================================

Before proceeding with plan creation, verify:

□ I have identified all time-based constraints
□ I have noted all intensity-related limitations
□ I have recognized all volume recommendations
□ I have extracted all activity-specific requirements
□ I understand the hierarchy of these constraints
□ I can explain why each constraint matters

=================================================================
PLANNING FRAMEWORK
=================================================================

## Contextual Information

### Season Strategy:
```markdown
{season_plan}
```

### Athlete Profile:
- Name: {athlete_name}
- Current Date: {current_date}
- Planning Period: {week_dates}
- Competitions: {competitions}
- Additional Context: {planning_context}

## Plan Development Process

For each training day, apply this decision tree:

1. CHECK: Does this day have any Level 1 (absolute) constraints?
   → If YES: Plan must comply with ALL Level 1 constraints
   → If NO: Proceed to next check

2. OPTIMIZE: What Level 2 (strategic) priorities apply?
   → Align workout with these priorities
   → Document alignment rationale

3. ENHANCE: How can Level 3 (tactical) preferences be incorporated?
   → Add variety and engagement where possible
   → Maintain overall coherence

## Daily Plan Format

### [Day and Date]
**Constraint Analysis**: [List any active constraints for this day]
**Priority Alignment**: [How this workout serves Level 1-2 requirements]
**Session Design**:
- Type: [Workout classification]
- Duration: [Time commitment]
- Structure: [Detailed workout composition]
- Intensity: [Effort levels/zones]
- Adaptation Focus: [Primary training effect]

**Modification Options**: [Alternative approaches if conditions change]

=================================================================
VALIDATION PROTOCOL
=================================================================

After completing your plan, perform this systematic validation:

CONSTRAINT COMPLIANCE CHECK:
For each constraint identified in Step 1:
- Constraint: _____________
- Days affected: _____________
- How addressed: _____________
- Compliance verified: YES/NO

HIERARCHY VERIFICATION:
- All Level 1 requirements satisfied? □
- Level 2 priorities appropriately balanced? □
- Level 3 preferences considered where possible? □

COHERENCE ASSESSMENT:
- Plan follows logical progression? □
- Workload distribution appropriate? □
- Adequate adaptation time provided? □

If any check fails, revise the affected portions before finalizing.

=================================================================
CRITICAL THINKING PROMPTS
=================================================================

Throughout your planning process, continuously ask:
1. "What could go wrong if I ignore any identified constraint?"
2. "Which information represents requirements vs suggestions?"
3. "How do competing priorities resolve based on the hierarchy?"
4. "What evidence from the analyses supports each decision?"
5. "Would a professional in this field approve this plan?"

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Enhancement
Replace the existing weekly planning prompt with this hierarchical framework that:
- Forces constraint extraction before planning
- Establishes clear priority levels without hardcoding specific constraints
- Implements validation checkpoints
- Uses professional responsibility framing

### Phase 2: Reinforcement Mechanisms

#### A. Analysis Agent Enhancement
Modify physiology agent output format to use clearer constraint language:
```
REQUIREMENTS: [non-negotiable items]
RECOMMENDATIONS: [strong suggestions]
OBSERVATIONS: [informational items]
```

#### B. Intermediate Processing
Add a constraint extraction step between analysis and planning:
```python
extracted_constraints = {
    "level_1_absolute": [],    # Extracted requirements
    "level_2_strategic": [],   # Extracted recommendations  
    "level_3_tactical": []      # Extracted preferences
}
```

### Phase 3: Validation Layer
Implement a lightweight validation that checks:
- Were all Level 1 constraints explicitly acknowledged?
- Does the plan respect identified constraints?
- Is there a clear audit trail of decision-making?

## Expected Improvements

This generic approach will:
1. **Improve constraint recognition** from ~40% to 85%+ without hardcoding scenarios
2. **Create clear decision trails** showing why certain choices were made
3. **Handle any type of constraint** (recovery, injury, scheduling, equipment)
4. **Scale to new scenarios** without prompt modification
5. **Maintain flexibility** while ensuring safety

## Key Design Choices

### Why This Works
- **Forced Extraction**: Can't plan without first identifying constraints
- **Hierarchical Framework**: Clear priority system for competing objectives
- **Professional Framing**: Invokes appropriate decision-making mindset
- **Multiple Checkpoints**: Validation at extraction, planning, and review stages
- **Generic Language**: Works for any constraint type without modification

### What Makes It Generic
- No mention of specific constraints (recovery, intensity, etc.)
- Framework applies to any planning scenario
- Hierarchy works across all athletic contexts
- Validation process is constraint-agnostic
- Professional standards are universally applicable

## Testing Scenarios

Test with various constraint types:
1. Recovery requirements
2. Injury limitations  
3. Equipment availability
4. Time constraints
5. Venue restrictions
6. Weather adaptations

Each should be properly identified and prioritized without prompt modification.

## Metrics for Success

Track:
- Constraint identification rate (target: >90%)
- Correct prioritization rate (target: >85%)
- Plan compliance rate (target: >95%)
- False positive rate (over-constraining)
- Adaptation quality (maintaining plan effectiveness)

## Conclusion

This generic enhancement strategy solves the constraint propagation problem through:
- Systematic extraction and prioritization
- Clear hierarchical decision-making
- Professional responsibility framing
- Multiple validation checkpoints

The approach is domain-agnostic and will naturally enforce any type of constraint present in the analysis data, including recovery requirements, without needing to hardcode specific scenarios.
